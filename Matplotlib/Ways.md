# Matplotlib ways

## Historic Bibilography

Matplotlib was initially developed as an alternative to MATLAB in Python, initailly intended to make transition from MATLAB to Python easier. So, matplotlib has 3 interfaces of using

* pyplot stateful way 
* PyLab way ( Alomost close to MATLAB )
* OO way ( recommended )

The current recommendation is to use OO way since it gives granualr control over the plots and is the most pythonic way to use matplotlib. pyplot stateful way is still could be used. PyLab is advised not to be used since it is not pythonic.
